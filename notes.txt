Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
        Only 25 Keywords
        - No access modifiers
        - No classes (only structs)
        - No reference types (everything is a value)
        - No inheritence (only composition)
        - No exceptions (only errors)
        - No "try catch finally" construct
        - No pointer arithmetic
        - No implicity type conversion

    2. Performance
        - Equivalent to C++
        - Close to hardware (No VM)
        - Cross compilation Support
        - Light weight concurrency model
        
    3. Support for concurrency
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            ex: go keyword, channel data type, range keyword, select case construct
        - Standard Library
            sync package
            sync/atomic package
