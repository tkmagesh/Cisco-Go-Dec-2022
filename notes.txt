Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
        Only 25 Keywords
        - No access modifiers
        - No classes (only structs)
        - No reference types (everything is a value)
        - No inheritence (only composition)
        - No exceptions (only errors)
        - No "try catch finally" construct
        - No pointer arithmetic
        - No implicity type conversion

    2. Performance
        - Equivalent to C++
        - Close to hardware (No VM)
        - Cross compilation Support
        - Light weight concurrency model

    3. Support for concurrency
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            ex: go keyword, channel data type, range keyword, select case construct
        - Standard Library
            sync package
            sync/atomic package


    To run a go program
        go run <file_name.go>

    To create a build
        go build <file_name.go>

    To create a build in a different name
        go build -o <binary_name> <file_name.go>

    To get the list of environment variables
        go env
        go env <variable_1> <variable_2>
            ex: go env GOOS GOARCH
    
    To change the environment variables
        go env -w <variable_1>=<value_1> <variable_2>=<value_2>
        ex:
            go env -w GOOS=windows GOARCH=386

    To get the list of supported platforms for cross compilation
        go tool dist list

    To cross compile
        GOOS=<target_os> GOARCH=<target_arch> go build <file_name.go>
        ex:
            GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build program.go

Data Types
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real[float32] + imaginary[float32])
    complex128 (read[float64] + imaginary[float64])

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (unicode code point)

variables
    Function scope
        := is supported
        CANNOT have unused variables

    Package scope
        := is NOT supported
        CAN have unused variables
